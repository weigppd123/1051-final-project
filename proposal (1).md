# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Malphite(League of Legends info bot)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A discord bot for the game of League of Legends. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This bot specializes in providing in-game info&Tips through commands in discord. For example, inputting a command of a specific champion would give you useful information of the champion such as builds, runes, spells, etc. This can make it more convenient for players to prepare for a match as they would not have to go to third party websites to learn these infos. I plan on doing this through Python. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
-Having the functions that returns the information of some of the champions. 
-Adding to bot to discord and working. 


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
-Including all champions in function. 
-Wecoming new discord users

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
-Improving the bot to have more commands than just info for champions. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
I will need to research the detailed steps in generating a bot user in discord and creating a a web server for it. In addition, I will need to create a discord connection and interact it with discord APIs. I think for most of this project I will need to conduct research and learn new skills, especially in making discord connection and the interaction of APIs. I also saw that I need to make a guild, or Discord's user interface in the process.
